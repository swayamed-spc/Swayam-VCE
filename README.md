# Swayam-VCE

Website and event platform for **Swayam**, the Entrepreneurship Cell of Vasavi College of Engineering, Hyderabad.
Students browse the event archive, register for upcoming events, pay by UPI, and get one QR ticket per event that
staff scan at the door. Black and amber design.

There is **no admin interface** in the website. Content is edited in code by the engineering team; event management,
payment verification, check-in and analytics are backend API endpoints used by the team's internal tools.

## Tech stack

**PERN**: PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js.

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React 18 + Vite 5, React Router 6, plain CSS (one design system file), qrcode.react |
| Backend | Node.js 20+, Express 5, one API (ES modules) |
| Database | PostgreSQL on Neon (serverless), accessed with Drizzle ORM |
| Auth | Custom JWT in an httpOnly cookie, bcrypt; Sign in with Google (Firebase verifies the Google account); password reset links; Cloudflare Turnstile |
| Payments | Manual UPI: the student pays the club's UPI QR and submits the UTR and amount; staff verify |

## Status

| Part | State |
|---|---|
| `frontend/` | Complete and connected to the API: home, events (upcoming, ongoing, past archive), event pages with registration and UPI payment, about and the 8 wing pages, login and signup (with Google), forgot and reset password, My tickets, QR ticket, profile, 404 |
| `backend/` | Complete: auth (password, Google, reset), events and seat availability, solo and team registrations, sub-events with pass-holder pricing, manual UPI payments with refund overflow and refunds, master QR tickets and check-in, analytics. 154 live end-to-end checks |

Before launch: send password-reset links by email (they are printed in the server terminal for now), add a real
Firebase project for Google sign-in, and use production Turnstile keys. See `docs/BACKEND.md`.

## Run it

Requires Node.js 20+ and a Neon database. Start the backend first; the site still shows the event archive without it.

```bash
# Backend (terminal 1)
cd backend
cp .env.example .env    # set DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, QR_SECRET (TURNSTILE_SECRET test key is pre-filled)
npm install
npm run db:push         # create or update the tables in Neon
npm run db:seed         # optional: test logins admin@, manager@, student@swayam.com (password Password123!)
npm run dev             # http://localhost:4000/health

# Frontend (terminal 2)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev             # http://localhost:5173
```

Optional: copy `frontend/.env.example` to `frontend/.env.local` and add the Firebase web settings to turn on
"Sign in with Google" (also set `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` in `backend/.env`).

## Checks

```bash
cd backend && npm run test:live      # 3 end-to-end suites against Neon; run before every deployment
cd frontend && npm run check:data    # event archive integrity and search
cd frontend && npm run check:render  # every page renders with its content
cd frontend && npm run build         # production build in frontend/dist
```

## Editing content

Club details and contact, team, wings and the Vision in Action stages are in `frontend/src/data/site.js`; the event archive is in
`frontend/src/data/events.js`. Live events are created through the API. Full guide: `docs/CONTENT_GUIDE.md`.
